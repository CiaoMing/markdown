**SwiftCash (SWIFT)** is the SplitFork of SmartCash as of block 633,000 - appx. 1st of September 2018 09:53:00 GMT. Driven by strong divisions between the community and the core team(SmartHives), about 80% of the total supply which was believed to be mostly controlled or owned by the core team (SmartHives), exchanges, hackers or exploiters, was burned which then turned into a unique experience with an amazing initial decentralization of power, supply ownership, as well as inflation. SwiftCash is an open-source, decentralized, peer-to-peer transactional cryptocurrency which also offers a solution to the problem posed by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bitcoin, and other Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies. Proof-of-Work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the electricity used by high-powered mining hardware and anyone with 51% hash power can control the network and double spend. SwiftCash utilizes the Green Protocol, an energy efficient Proof-of-Stake algorithm inspired by Bitcoin Green, can be mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining equipment. The Green Protocol offers a simple solution to Bitcoin sustainability issues and provides a faster, more scalable blockchain that is better suited for daily transactional use.
